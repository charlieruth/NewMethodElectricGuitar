The New Method for Electric Guitar Performance: an Introduction.

Prelude.

The book that follows is the result of years of performance and pedagogy; through the learning I've integrated,
the lessons I've ruminated and reflected upon, and careless injuries suffered, this new method has arrived. 

It is true that many a great guitarist have lived their musical lives without the aid of formal lessons 
or method books - some have argued that their musical output, being 'free' of formal strictures ended up being raw,
untamed, rebellious. Whether or not that has been the case is beyond the scope of this method. I approach the writing of this little book and the establishment
of these ideas not as some sort of correction or academic pursuit. Rather, it is because I feel strongly that the electric guitar, specifically, is under-theorized
and under-developed in terms of its pedagogical tradition and methodology. Other instruments within the Western system have a longer history both in terms of
their existence within the culture, and in their pedagogical theorizing. Put more simply: teachers and students of other instruments enjoy a much more thorough
and carefully considered approach to their instruments. 

This first iteration of this method is not intended to be an absolute beginner's first method book. Rather, it is laid out topically, examining parts of 
the body and their best-possible integration with the instrument. By the end of the book, it should be clear that playing the guitar involves the entire body
working with syncronicity and with the least possible effort. 

Every topic in this book, every exercise, every technical examination is based upon an encompassing concept: fundamental motion. Fundamental motion, or 'primordial'
motion, as I am apt to call it, refers simply to the anatomical fact that the human body has evolved to favor and emphasize certain motions. These motions, 
being fundamental, are part of our physiological heritage, our basic construction; to move against them risks injury, pain, and loss of time playing our instruments.
I have not known another teacher to discuss approaching the electric guitar with this basic rule in mind, though the development of this method is heavily indebted
to the wisdom I've received studying with Dr. Philip Alejo, Professor of Double Bass at the University of Arizona, Tucson. 

The lessons I received focused almost entirely on the most basic exercises; creating a strong and responsive sound, tracing and planning motions, integrating 
ever-more muscle groups, all with the most minimal of efforts. Rather than focusing effort upon physical exertion, the effort was instead turned toward 
self-examination; the teacher must assist the student in becoming more self-aware and constructively critical in their observation and execution. That is to say,
if one is to "get good," the first step must be to learn how to analyze the technical challenge at hand, and address the root concern with fundamental motion.
It is my core belief that ALL technical challenges on the instrument can be surmounted through the careful and directed use of self-produced exercises that 
pinpoint the fundamental motion necessary to the problem. 

In line with this thinking, we must consider that the primary goal of this book's underlying pedagogy and philosophy is to lead the student to a self-awareness 
that in turn functions to produce new exercises, insight, and approaches to technical challenges faced by the student. Perhaps then, similar to Kodaly, this 
may be less of a method from the strict definition of technics and perhaps more akin to the development of a theory or philosophy of kinesthetics. The exercises I
describe in this text should then be thought of as examples of the philosophy at work; students should derive their own simple exercises from the music they are
engaging with, and the technical challenges therein. I do not maintain that the exercises I have composed for this book are sacrosanct or even necessarily perfectly
suited to a possible set of challenges - they are not just examples, but letters to home by a soujouner seeking the connected-ness of all things.


How to Use this Book

It is recommended that students first engaging with this text practice and perform the exercises contained within, but then, as previously stated, use the approach
to develop their own exercises designed to smooth and control fundamental motions. Again, simple completion of a given exercise is not the point. The journey itself,
deconstructing and reconstructing exercises themselves in pursuit of relaxation, total control, and effortless accuracy is itself the path and the proper execution
of the exercise. Follow the tempo guides carefully, and -take seriously- the reflection prompts at the end of each exercise. To gloss over the reflection throws out
the focused execution of the exercise. To execute the exercises without focus and intention is a futile gesture. 

((((what is the plan for the exercises themselves? Each one is introduced and given a simple name. Make a short write up in bullet points. The exercise is written
in both notation and tablature with a video link. Sometimes, they don't need specific notation, but a step by step description. The reflection points are highly important:
what are students supposed to focus on? Brief reflection should be done at the end of each exercise, following certain procedures - that is, the order of the prompts 
should lead the student to making the appropriate connections and revelations throughout the process... ))))

Seated Position.

This method begins with an examination of the seated position. In order for us to realize the full potential of our arms, hands, and fingers, with must firstly ensure
that our body is best supporting them. We must act from a position of balance and strength.

The guitarist is to be seated at the edge of a chair. The chair should be at an ideal height, so that the student's legs extend out straight from the seat to form a
virtually 90 angle at the knee. Feet should be slightly greater than shoulder length apart with the soles flat on the floor. The spine should be tall with its natural
S-curve at the lower part of the back, balanced and strong sitting atop the pelvis that is angled slightly forward. From this position, the student should feel balanced,
able to stand at a moment's notice, and thoroughly unlikely to be pushed over by a strong gust of wind. 

The guitar is to be secured to the body near the middle of the torso with a strap (strap-locks/washers are mandatory) with the lower bout of the guitar resting between the student's legs. The neck of the guitar
will then be pointed to the ceiling at a 45-55 degree angle from the student's body. This setup may remind some students of the classical guitar seated position, though
with one difference: the guitar may touch the tops of the student's legs, but will not be rested upon them. It is absolutely necessary that the student's posture by upright
and supported for the guitar to sit properly on the torso without dragging the body or causing injury. For those using heavier guitars, particular focus should be given to
maintaining the support from the core to maintain an upright posture. 

The positioning of the guitar in this seated position is intended to reproduce the position of the guitar in the standing position. Naturally, it is expected that the player
will continue to focus on supportive, upright posture when standing. From your seated position, try standing. The guitar should remain in precisely the same position between your seated and standing position.
This is another focus of the method; reproducability. By maintaining the same guitar position in the seated and standing position, the player will effectively eliminate 
the introduction of additional variables into the performance process. The mapping of the guitar with the body will be strengthened through correct repetition without 
guesswork. 





The Left Hand.






The Right Hand.

The right hand deserves special consideration and attention as, with rare exception, initiates the sound. It has often been the case that methods, videos, and instructional materials have spent considerable time focusing on the left hand; indeed, even our impulse is to focus on the movement and articulations of the left hand, as if the essence of the performance is held in the left hand.

This method presumes the use of a pick. We will begin by constructing a theory of the pick.

Pick Cradle.

It is recommended to use a heavy pick, > 1.5mm in thickness. Choose a pick with a prominent logo or design. Follow these steps to arrive at the pick cradle:

Grasp the very tip of the pick with your left hand, holding the pick in place while we set our fingers.
Lay your right hand thumb directly across the logo on the pick so that the edge of the thumb runs perpendicular to the tip of the pick (with your thumb forming a 90 degree angle with an imaginary line bisecting the pick from the tip). 
The right hand’s index and middle finger will now be added along the underside of the pick for support. 
Important. The pointer and middle fingers’ point of contact will be at an angle. The pointer finger’s tip will point parallel to the tip of the pick, with the center of the pad touching the edge of the pick, though with slightly more of the pad underneath the pick. The middle finger will be under the opposite edge of the pick, but with the index-finger-side edge of the finger in contact with the pick. ((Imagine you are handing someone a piece of paper, grasping the paper with these same three fingers. This motion feels quite natural, perhaps somewhat instinctual. 
Remove the helping grasp of the left hand. If the cradle is executed properly, the pick should feel as though it is balanced between the three right hand fingers. It should feel as though you may drop the pick if its tip is pointed toward the ground. There should only be a small amount of point sticking out. 


From this position, as odd as it may possibly feel to you, we have complete control over the pick using motions amongst those three fingers that feel very natural. 

At no point will the index or middle finger become flattened against the underside of the pick. In line with the theory of fundamental motion,
