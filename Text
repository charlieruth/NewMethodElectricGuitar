The New Method for Electric Guitar Performance: an Introduction.

Prelude.

The book that follows is the result of years of performance and pedagogy; through the learning I've integrated,
the lessons I've ruminated and reflected upon, and careless injuries suffered, this new method has arrived. 

It is true that many a great guitarist have lived their musical lives without the aid of formal lessons 
or method books - some have argued that their musical output, being 'free' of formal strictures ended up being raw,
untamed, rebellious. Whether or not that has been the case is beyond the scope of this method. I approach the writing of this little book and the establishment
of these ideas not as some sort of correction or academic pursuit. Rather, it is because I feel strongly that the electric guitar, specifically, is under-theorized
and under-developed in terms of its pedagogical tradition and methodology. Other instruments within the Western system have a longer history both in terms of
their existence within the culture, and in their pedagogical theorizing. Put more simply: teachers and students of other instruments enjoy a much more thorough
and carefully considered approach to their instruments. 

This first iteration of this method is not intended to be an absolute beginner's first method book. Rather, it is laid out topically, examining parts of 
the body and their best-possible integration with the instrument. By the end of the book, it should be clear that playing the guitar involves the entire body
working with syncronicity and with the least possible effort. 

Every topic in this book, every exercise, every technical examination is based upon an encompassing concept: fundamental motion. Fundamental motion, or 'primordial'
motion, as I am apt to call it, refers simply to the anatomical fact that the human body has evolved to favor and emphasize certain motions. These motions, 
being fundamental, are part of our physiological heritage, our basic construction; to move against them risks injury, pain, and loss of time playing our instruments.
I have not known another teacher to discuss approaching the electric guitar with this basic rule in mind, though the development of this method is heavily indebted
to the wisdom I've received studying with Dr. Philip Alejo, Professor of Double Bass at the University of Arizona, Tucson. 

The lessons I received focused almost entirely on the most basic exercises; creating a strong and responsive sound, tracing and planning motions, integrating 
ever-more muscle groups, all with the most minimal of efforts. Rather than focusing effort upon physical exertion, the effort was instead turned toward 
self-examination; the teacher must assist the student in becoming more self-aware and constructively critical in their observation and execution. That is to say,
if one is to "get good," the first step must be to learn how to analyze the technical challenge at hand, and address the root concern with fundamental motion.
It is my core belief that ALL technical challenges on the instrument can be surmounted through the careful and directed use of self-produced exercises that 
pinpoint the fundamental motion necessary to the problem.
